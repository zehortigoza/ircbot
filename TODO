COMMANDS

- Decision maker: add a way for the bot to respond to queries like "x
  or y?". For historical reasons, also support "ou" as a trigger
  keyword.

      <person> bot: go to the beach or go to the mountains?
      <bot> go to the beach, of course!

- URL title fetcher. When an URL is popped into the channel, it grabs
  the title. Need to be careful with large files, so use HTTP HEAD to
  figure out whether is worth the trouble (and if it says is an
  HTML). Then pull up and extract the title.

- URL repository, with counts. So people can look at old / most common
  recommended links.

- Some sort of dictionary, that people can add and remove information
  dynamically. Useful for storing information that are helpful but
  scathered among various sites: e.g. max hours.

- %team: ability to create/add-people/remove-people from a team. The
  command then can be used to mass ping people.

      <person> %team pod let's eat folks!
      <bot> personA: personB: personC: let's eat folks!

- Ability to schedule alarms:

      <person> %alarm 12pm it is high noon
      ...
      <bot> person: it is high noon!

OTHER

- Organize so the handlers can spawn Go routines and asynchronously
  send messages.

- Handler that expose other interfaces to the bot (both the message
  log and ability to "say" things back). This would allow trying out
  features outside from the bot code.

- Versioning of the DB tables, so we can upgrade them if we add
  columns.
